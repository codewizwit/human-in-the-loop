  </context>

  <instructions>
  Perform a comprehensive bias analysis across the following dimensions:

  ### 1. Gender Bias
  **What to detect**:
  - Gendered language that assumes roles, capabilities, or characteristics
  - Masculine defaults (e.g., "he" for generic person, "guys" for groups)
  - Stereotypical associations (e.g., nurses as women, engineers as men)
  - Exclusion of non-binary and gender non-conforming individuals
  - Assumptions about gender presentation or expression

  **Examples**:
  - ❌ "A developer should test his code thoroughly"
  - ✅ "Developers should test their code thoroughly"
  - ❌ "Man-hours required for project"
  - ✅ "Person-hours" or "Work hours required for project"

  ### 2. Racial and Ethnic Bias
  **What to detect**:
  - Assumptions about names, cultural practices, or capabilities based on race/ethnicity
  - Stereotypical characterizations or associations
  - Exclusionary language or imagery (whitelist/blacklist)
  - Cultural appropriation or misrepresentation
  - Colorism in language or descriptions

  **Examples**:
  - ❌ "blacklist/whitelist"
  - ✅ "blocklist/allowlist" or "denylist/allowlist"
  - ❌ Assuming English-only names or Western naming conventions
  - ✅ Supporting diverse name formats and cultural naming practices

  ### 3. Age Bias
  **What to detect**:
  - Assumptions about technical capability based on age
  - Ageist language ("digital native", "too old to learn")
  - Exclusion of older or younger individuals in examples
  - Stereotypes about generational traits or preferences

  **Examples**:
  - ❌ "Even your grandma can use this interface"
  - ✅ "This interface is designed to be intuitive for all users"
  - ❌ Assuming all users are young and tech-savvy
  - ✅ Inclusive design considering diverse age groups and abilities

  ### 4. Disability Bias
  **What to detect**:
  - Ableist language or assumptions about capability
  - Inaccessible design patterns or content
  - Person-first vs. identity-first language misuse
  - Assumptions about physical, cognitive, or sensory abilities
  - Lack of accommodation considerations

  **Examples**:
  - ❌ "Click here" (not accessible for screen readers)
  - ✅ "Select the 'Submit' button to continue"
  - ❌ "This feature is only for normal users"
  - ✅ "This feature is available to all users"
  - ❌ Relying solely on color to convey information
  - ✅ Using multiple visual cues (color + icon + text label)

  ### 5. Cultural and Religious Bias
  **What to detect**:
  - Assumptions about holidays, calendars, or cultural practices
  - Western-centric or monocultural perspectives
  - Religious assumptions or exclusions
  - Language or imagery that marginalizes non-dominant cultures
  - Ethnocentric design decisions

  **Examples**:
  - ❌ "Everyone celebrates Christmas"
  - ✅ "During the holiday season" or "End of year"
  - ❌ Assuming Monday-Friday work weeks globally
  - ✅ Configurable work week settings
  - ❌ Date formats assuming MM/DD/YYYY
  - ✅ Locale-aware date formatting

  ### 6. Socioeconomic Bias
  **What to detect**:
  - Assumptions about access to resources, technology, or services
  - Language that stigmatizes poverty or economic status
  - Exclusionary pricing or feature gatekeeping language
  - Assumptions about education level or literacy
  - Class-based stereotypes

  **Examples**:
  - ❌ "Just upgrade to the latest iPhone"
  - ✅ "Works on devices from 2018 onwards"
  - ❌ Assuming high-speed internet connectivity
  - ✅ Offline-first or low-bandwidth options
  - ❌ Using financial status as capability indicator
  - ✅ Inclusive language about access and resources

  ### 7. Intersectionality
  **What to detect**:
  - Overlapping biases affecting multiply marginalized groups
  - Assumptions that ignore intersectional identities
  - One-dimensional diversity that misses compound discrimination
  - Failure to consider diverse lived experiences

  **Examples**:
  - Considering how a feature might affect a disabled person of color
  - Recognizing experiences of older LGBTQ+ individuals
  - Understanding challenges for low-income immigrants

      ---

      ### Detailed Findings

      #### Finding #1: Cultural and Linguistic Discrimination

      **Severity**: 🔴 Critical

      **Location**:
      ```javascript
      if (user.language !== 'en') {
        return { eligible: false, reason: 'English only support' };
      }
      ```

      **Issue Description**:
      Code explicitly excludes non-English speakers from support, creating a discriminatory barrier based on language and national origin.

      **Affected Groups**:
      - Non-native English speakers
      - Users from non-English speaking countries
      - Multilingual users who prefer their native language
      - Potentially millions of global users

      **Impact Assessment**:
      - **Harm Potential**: Direct exclusion from product features and support
      - **Scope**: Could affect 75% of global population (non-native English speakers)
      - **Severity Justification**: This is discriminatory gatekeeping that violates accessibility and inclusion principles

      **Alternative Approach**:
      ```javascript
      // Provide multilingual support
      function validateUser(username, password) {
        const supportedLanguages = ['en', 'es', 'fr', 'de', 'ja', 'zh', 'ar', 'hi'];
        const userLanguage = supportedLanguages.includes(user.language)
          ? user.language
          : 'en'; // fallback to English

        return {
          eligible: true,
          supportLanguage: userLanguage,
          translationAvailable: true
        };
      }
      ```

      **Rationale**:
      - Removes discriminatory language barrier
      - Provides multilingual support or translation
      - Makes product accessible globally
      - Demonstrates commitment to inclusion

      ---

      #### Finding #2: Age Discrimination

      **Severity**: 🔴 Critical

      **Location**:
      ```javascript
      if (user.age > 65) {
        return { eligible: false, reason: 'Advanced features restricted' };
      }
      ```

      **Issue Description**:
      Code explicitly restricts features based solely on age, demonstrating ageist assumptions about capability and creating illegal age discrimination.

      **Affected Groups**:
      - Users over 65 years old
      - Older adults who are fully capable of using technology
      - Violates age discrimination laws in many jurisdictions

      **Impact Assessment**:
      - **Harm Potential**: Exclusion from product features based on age stereotype
      - **Scope**: Affects growing demographic of older technology users
      - **Severity Justification**: This is illegal discrimination in many countries (Age Discrimination Act, ADEA)

      **Alternative Approach**:
      ```javascript
      // Remove age-based restrictions entirely
      // If complexity is a concern, offer optional simplified mode for ALL users
      function validateUser(username, password) {
        return {
          eligible: true,
          uiMode: user.preferences.simpleMode ? 'simplified' : 'advanced',
          // Let users choose their own experience level
        };
      }
      ```

      **Rationale**:
      - Removes illegal age discrimination
      - Allows users of any age to choose their experience level
      - Respects user autonomy and capability
      - Age is not an indicator of technical ability

      ---

      #### Finding #3: Gender Assumption

      **Severity**: 🟠 High

      **Location**:
      ```javascript
      console.log(`Welcome back, ${user.name}. We hope he enjoys the new features.`);
      ```

      **Issue Description**:
      Code assumes all users use he/him pronouns, excluding women, non-binary individuals, and users with other pronouns.

      **Affected Groups**:
      - Women users
      - Non-binary and gender non-conforming users
      - Anyone who doesn't use he/him pronouns

      **Impact Assessment**:
      - **Harm Potential**: Misgendering causes psychological harm and signals exclusion
      - **Scope**: Affects 50%+ of user base
      - **Severity Justification**: Direct misgendering that alienates majority of users

      **Alternative Phrasing**:
      ```javascript
      // Option 1: Use they/them (gender-neutral)
      console.log(`Welcome back, ${user.name}. We hope you enjoy the new features.`);

      // Option 2: Respect user's pronouns
      console.log(`Welcome back, ${user.name}. We hope ${user.pronouns.subject} enjoys the new features.`);

      // Option 3: Avoid pronouns entirely (often best)
      console.log(`Welcome back, ${user.name}. Enjoy the new features!`);
      ```

      **Rationale**:
      - Gender-neutral language includes all users
      - Respecting stated pronouns affirms identity
      - Avoiding pronouns when possible is cleanest solution

      ---

      ### Fairness Metrics

      **Representation Analysis**:
      - ❌ No diverse representation - actively excludes groups
      - ❌ Enforces harmful stereotypes (older people can't use tech)
      - ❌ Discriminatory language used explicitly

      **Accessibility Score**: 15/100
      - Language accessibility: Excludes non-English speakers
      - Content accessibility: Age-based restrictions
      - Design inclusivity: Gender assumptions

      **Inclusivity Checklist**:
      - [ ] Gender-neutral language used
      - [ ] Racially inclusive language and examples
      - [ ] Age-inclusive assumptions
      - [ ] Disability-aware content
      - [ ] Culturally sensitive and globally aware
      - [ ] Socioeconomically inclusive
      - [ ] Intersectional considerations addressed

      **Score**: 0/7 criteria met

      ---

      ### Recommendations

      **Immediate Actions** (Critical/High severity):
      1. **Remove language restriction** - Support multiple languages or remove eligibility check entirely
      2. **Remove age-based feature restrictions** - This is illegal discrimination
      3. **Use gender-neutral language** - Switch to "you" or they/them pronouns
      4. **Legal review** - Consult legal team about discrimination liability

      **Important Improvements** (Medium severity):
      1. Implement proper internationalization (i18n) framework
      2. Add user preference system for pronouns
      3. Conduct accessibility audit

      **Best Practice Enhancements** (Low severity):
      1. Add diverse user examples in documentation
      2. Test with users across age ranges, languages, and abilities
      3. Establish bias review process for all code

      ---

      ### Best Practices for Future Content

      **General Guidelines**:
      - Never gate features based on protected characteristics (age, language, etc.)
      - Default to inclusive, gender-neutral language
      - Design for global, multicultural audiences
      - Test assumptions about users with diverse groups
      - Follow WCAG accessibility guidelines

      **Inclusive Language Resources**:
      - Google Developer Documentation Style Guide (inclusive language)
      - Microsoft Style Guide (bias-free communication)
      - W3C Internationalization Best Practices
      - Conscious Style Guide

      ---

      ### Human Review Required

      **Recommended Reviewers**:
      - Legal counsel (age discrimination laws)
      - Diversity and inclusion team
      - Accessibility specialists
      - International user advocates
      - Representatives from affected communities

      **Legal Risk**: High - age and language discrimination may violate laws in many jurisdictions

      ### Executive Summary
      - **Overall Bias Risk**: 🟠 High
      - **Categories Detected**: Disability Bias, Religious/Cultural Bias, Socioeconomic Bias, Age Bias (implicit)
      - **Severity Assessment**: Multiple exclusionary assumptions that prevent inclusive participation
      - **Recommendation**: ⚠️ Deploy with Significant Changes Required

      ---

      ### Detailed Findings

      #### Finding #1: Physical Ability Assumptions

      **Severity**: 🟠 High

      **Location**: "Rock climbing wall (test your limits!)" and mandatory participation language

      **Issue Description**:
      Event assumes all team members have physical ability to rock climb and participate in intense physical activities. Language suggests non-participation is not acceptable.

      **Affected Groups**:
      - People with physical disabilities
      - People with chronic illnesses or injuries
      - Pregnant individuals
      - People with mobility limitations
      - Anyone uncomfortable with physical activities

      **Impact Assessment**:
      - **Harm Potential**: Exclusion from team bonding, pressure to disclose disability
      - **Scope**: 15-20% of workforce may have disabilities (visible or invisible)
      - **Severity Justification**: Creates hostile environment for disabled employees

      **Alternative Approach**:
      ```markdown
      ## Team Building Event

      **Rationale**:
      - Provides multiple participation options
      - Makes physical activities optional, not mandatory
      - Removes pressure to disclose disabilities
      - Creates genuinely inclusive environment

      ---

      #### Finding #2: Religious and Cultural Exclusion

      **Severity**: 🔴 Critical

      **Location**: "Date: December 25th"

      **Issue Description**:
      Scheduling mandatory team event on Christmas Day excludes non-Christian employees and forces them to choose between religious observance and work participation.

      **Affected Groups**:
      - Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and non-Christian employees
      - Atheist/agnostic employees who don't celebrate Christmas
      - Employees who celebrate with family on this day
      - International employees from non-Christian cultures

      **Impact Assessment**:
      - **Harm Potential**: Forces choice between religion/culture and job
      - **Scope**: Could affect 30%+ of diverse workforce
      - **Severity Justification**: Religious discrimination and cultural insensitivity

      **Alternative Approach**:
      ```markdown
      Date: January 15th (avoiding major religious holidays)

      Note: We've chosen this date to avoid conflicts with winter holidays celebrated by our diverse team. If you observe a holiday or have a conflict on this date, please let us know.
      ```

      **Rationale**:
      - Respects religious diversity
      - Avoids major religious holidays
      - Acknowledges diverse cultural backgrounds
      - Demonstrates inclusive planning

      ---

      #### Finding #3: Alcohol-Centric Socialization

      **Severity**: 🟡 Medium

      **Location**: "Happy hour with craft cocktails"

      **Issue Description**:
      Centering social activity around alcohol excludes people who don't drink for religious, health, cultural, or personal reasons.

      **Affected Groups**:
      - People in recovery from addiction
      - People with religious prohibitions (Muslim, Mormon, etc.)
      - People with health conditions
      - Pregnant individuals
      - People who simply don't drink

      **Impact Assessment**:
      - **Harm Potential**: Social exclusion, pressure to drink, triggering for people in recovery
      - **Scope**: 30-40% of adults don't drink or drink minimally
      - **Severity Justification**: Creates exclusionary social environment

      **Alternative Approach**:
      ```markdown
      Refreshments: Wide variety of beverages including craft cocktails, mocktails, specialty coffee and tea, fresh juices, and sparkling water.

      Note: We're committed to creating an inclusive social environment where everyone feels comfortable, regardless of whether they drink alcohol.
      ```

      **Rationale**:
      - Equally emphasizes non-alcoholic options
      - Removes alcohol as social center
      - Respects diverse reasons for not drinking
      - Creates genuinely inclusive social space

      ---

      #### Finding #4: Socioeconomic Assumptions

      **Severity**: 🟡 Medium

      **Location**: "street parking available" and "Business casual" dress code

      **Issue Description**:
      Assumes employees own cars and have business casual attire, which may create financial burden or accessibility barriers.

      **Affected Groups**:
      - Employees who rely on public transit
      - Employees who don't own cars
      - People with disabilities who need accessible parking
      - Employees with limited clothing budgets
      - Junior employees with lower salaries

      **Impact Assessment**:
      - **Harm Potential**: Financial burden, accessibility barrier, class-based exclusion
      - **Scope**: Variable depending on employee demographics
      - **Severity Justification**: Creates unnecessary barriers to participation

      **Alternative Approach**:
      ```markdown
      **Location**: Downtown venue
      - Accessible via Metro (Green Line, Central Station)
      - Accessible parking available in attached garage
      - Rideshare reimbursement available upon request

      **Attire**: Casual and comfortable - wear what makes you feel good! No dress code.
      ```

      **Rationale**:
      - Provides multiple transportation options
      - Mentions accessibility explicitly
      - Removes financial barrier of dress code
      - Demonstrates awareness of diverse circumstances

      ---

      #### Finding #5: Late Night Timing Assumptions

      **Severity**: 🟡 Medium

      **Location**: "Time: 6 PM - 11 PM" and "Late night activities"

      **Issue Description**:
      Late timing excludes caregivers, people with early schedules, and assumes everyone can participate in evening activities.

      **Affected Groups**:
      - Parents and caregivers
      - People with early work schedules
      - People with chronic conditions requiring regular sleep
      - People who use public transit (service may end early)

      **Impact Assessment**:
      - **Harm Potential**: Exclusion from team bonding
      - **Scope**: Parents, caregivers, and others with scheduling constraints
      - **Severity Justification**: Unnecessarily excludes employees with care responsibilities

      **Alternative Approach**:
      ```markdown
      **Time**: 3 PM - 8 PM (flexible arrival and departure)

      Note: Core activities run 4-7 PM. Come when you can, leave when you need to. We want this to work for everyone's schedules, including those with caregiving responsibilities.
      ```

      **Rationale**:
      - Earlier timing accommodates caregivers
      - Flexible attendance respects diverse schedules
      - Explicitly welcomes partial participation
      - Acknowledges caregiving responsibilities

      ---
