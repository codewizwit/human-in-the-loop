# Personalized Learning Path Generator

Creates customized learning paths for engineers based on their skills, career goals, and time constraints. Focused on Angular and frontend engineering growth.

## What It Does

- **Assesses** current skills vs target skills
- **Creates** phased learning curricula with milestones
- **Balances** theory with hands-on practice (30/70 split)
- **Includes** realistic time commitments and check-ins

## Learning Path Types

| Type                  | Use Case                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Level Progression** | Junior to Mid, Senior to Staff     |
| **Skill Acquisition** | Learn Angular, RxJS, NgRx          |
| **Role Transition**   | Backend to Full-Stack with Angular |
| **Specialization**    | Frontend Architecture, Performance |

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Junior to Mid-Level Angular Developer

```
Create a learning path for a junior Angular developer who wants to become mid-level. They know Angular basics, HTML/CSS, and TypeScript fundamentals. They want to focus on RxJS and testing. 6 month timeline.
```

**What You Get:**

- Skills assessment table (current vs target)
- 4-phase curriculum (TypeScript/RxJS, Testing, Advanced Angular, Professional Skills)
- Weekly time commitment breakdown
- Success criteria checklist
- Monthly check-in schedule

### Example 2: Backend to Full-Stack (Angular)

```
I'm a backend engineer (Node.js, NestJS, 3 years experience) wanting to learn Angular to become full-stack. I have basic HTML/CSS knowledge and know TypeScript well. 4 month timeline, can dedicate 10 hours/week.
```

**What You Get:**

- Leverageable skills mapping (NestJS to Angular parallels)
- 4-phase curriculum focused on Angular and frontend gaps
- Daily/weekly schedule for 10 hours
- Nx monorepo integration milestones

### Example 3: Senior to Staff Angular Engineer

```
Create a learning path for a senior Angular engineer (5 years) who wants to reach staff level. Strong technically with Angular/RxJS but needs to improve influence, architecture decisions, and cross-team leadership. 12 month timeline.
```

**What You Get:**

- Mindset shift guidance (senior vs staff)
- Focus on architecture and organizational impact
- Frontend strategy development
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## Output Structure

Every learning path includes:

1. **Header** - Current state, goal, timeline, focus areas
2. **Skills Assessment** - Current vs target level table
3. **Phased Curriculum** - Learning topics, practice, milestones
4. **Weekly Schedule** - Realistic time allocation
5. **Success Criteria** - Concrete goal indicators
6. **Check-in Schedule** - Progress review cadence

## Time Commitment Guidelines

| Hours/Week | Suitable For                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 2-4        | Skill polish, staying current  |
| 5-8        | New skill acquisition          |
| 10-15      | Role transition, deep learning |
| 15+        | Career pivot, intensive growth |
